## Hi

My name is Filip Kwiatkowski, and this is my private GitHub account.

My work-related[^pjatk] account can be found here: [Filip-FK-Kwiatkowski](https://github.com/Filip-FK-Kwiatkowski).

[^pjatk]: I am currently employed as a tutor and a lecturer at [Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology](https://pja.edu.pl/en/).

I develop and maintain [Lords of Legacy](https://lordsoflegacy.github.io/)'s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lordsoflegacy/lordsoflegacy.github.io), which is the base for the aforelinked website hosted GitHub Pages.

Outside of academia, I have been breifly employed by [Samsung](https://www.samsung.com) and [Bio Planet](https://bioplanet.pl/) on various developer positions, plus I do a little bit of freelancing.
